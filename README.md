If there are troubles with access to Schumann Resonance Miknevo data through the link https://idg5.chph.ras.ru/geospheres-dynamics/schumann_resonances/ please address to eggoncharov@vniia.ru.

Python script for two stage magnetic field time series processing to extract ELF spectrum and parameters of global electromagnetic resonances, so called Schumann Resonances. This script was initially constructed for magnetometers' data processing at Mikhnevo observatory (Moscow) of Institute of Geosphere Dynamics RAS.

For more detailed information see doc/manual.
