__Structure__
File "schumann_processing_class.py" contains "Schumann_processing" class, which is used to parse diurnal magnetic field time series from text file, calculate ELF spectral data and 
Schumann Resonance parameters.
File "example.py" contains example of script usage.

***Input data***
Binary h5 file with diurnal time series of magnetic field components, for example

*******************
Magnetometers dump rate is 256 Hz, that is why diurnal input file contains 22118400 samples.

***Output data***
Each output diurnal file is organized in binary h5 format. It ontaines three datasets:
    - fourier spectrum,
    - approximation curve parameters,
    - approximation curve errors.
"Fourier spectrum" represents 2d periodogram, consisting of ELF spectra (5-40 Hz) for each 12-min interval. It is characterized with attributes: amplitude, accumulation interval, max/min frequency, window 
width and spectral frequency step.

"Approximation curve parameters" represents 2d dataset (time_intervals x SR parameters), consisting of SR parameter arrays for each 12-min interval.
Every array has a form: [a1, a2, a3, f1, f2, f3, s1, s2, s3, m, n] and describes a Lorensian curve (with additional linear term) for the first 3 SR. 
"fi" is i-th resonance frequency, "ai" is i-th peak amplitude, "si" is i-th resonance peak width, "m", "n" - represent additional linear term.

"Approximation curve errors" represents 2d dataset of "Approximation curve parameters" errors, resulting from ELF spectrum approximation procedure.
